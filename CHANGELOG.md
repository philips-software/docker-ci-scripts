## [Unreleased]

- [#48] - Loop through entire array of push-branches

## v3.1.0 - 2020-09-23
- Allow users to specify multiple branches to push to the artifact repository. `push-branches`

### DEPRECATION
- [#47] - `push-branch` is now deprecated by `push-branches`. Will be removed in next major release.

## v3.0.0 - 2020-09-15

### BREAKING
- Allow users to specify specific dockerfile instead of path

The `docker build` command is now being called from the root of the project
instead of the directory. 

This has impact when your project has:
- Directories with multiple dockerfiles
- The dockerfile contains an `ADD` or a `COPY` command.

You now need to change the path to include the directory.

Example:
- `ADD /scripts/entrypoint.sh entrypoint.sh` becomes: `ADD /6/java/scripts/entrypoint.sh entrypoint`
